Directory 'testCode' is for random 1-2 files to test a concept
Directory 'include' is finalized header files 
Directory 'src' is finalized class files
Directory 'drivers' is for main executing classes

Anything not ready to go into the last 3 go into test code. A cmake file is expected, or a build/run.sh file.
