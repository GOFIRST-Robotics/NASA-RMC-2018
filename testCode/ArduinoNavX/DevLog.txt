-Working on Arduino getting NavX to work with arduino, attempting to grab only the accels and yaw,roll,pitch isn't working perhaps an issue with what is being pulled by requestFrom()?
-Important Note: Baud 115200
-made a navXangles.ino in personal files because thats how arduino ide is setup, cleared out UART and SPI code from example and attempting to get the specific values now
