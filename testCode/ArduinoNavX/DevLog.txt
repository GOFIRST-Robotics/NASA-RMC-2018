-Working on Arduino getting NavX to work with arduino, attempting to grab only the accels and yaw,roll,pitch isn't working perhaps an issue with what is being pulled by requestFrom()?
-Important Note: Baud 115200
-made a navXangles.ino in personal files because thats how arduino ide is setup, cleared out UART and SPI code from example and attempting to get the specific values now

Andrew:
-Continuing goal of getting data from NavX through Arduino
-Still can't get data from Accelerometer and Gyros at the same time
-Got byte info from gyro to print to the arduino serial console
-used navX built-in byte to float converter,
 however yaw claims to be rotation around x (inaccurate),
 roll and pitch print 0. Likely an issue with how I'm dealing with the input 
 arrays.
-changed beginTransmission input to be 50 (decimal of 0x32)
