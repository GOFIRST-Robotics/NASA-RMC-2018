This class was made long before this, but now I'm adding support for arbitrary channel communication, as the rpi will communicate over ethernet two the UP board & arduino, as well as our laptop by wifi. 
This previously just supported the one dedicated wifi connection and arbitrary file descriptors / select access, but will be expanded to multiple.
Development began with a dropbuffer / message holding queue, to prevent dropped msgs while keeping UDP, but that was too complicated & unneccessary, so all development continued with the NoBuffer versions. 
This change will act on the NoBuffer version, and will be sectioned under folder Telecomm2. 

I took a look, and the Telecomm here isn't sync'd with the Telecomm in main. Need to make sure that works first. 
May not have to do anything, could just have separate Telecomm instances for each thing - would simplify things.
