Jude: Began investigating point cloud library pcl for doing pointcloud stuff. 
Installed library through webpage 
https://larrylisky.com/2016/11/03/point-cloud-library-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts/
First the dependancies, then the dep file. Mint has an application to do that automatically. 

Getting an error when trying simple tutorial.
In /usr/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfig.cmake, it sets the root dir, PCL_ROOT, to /usr/local/, when it's actually all in /usr/. Edit line ~746ish to change PCL_ROOT to /usr.

How to install PCL
See https://larrylisky.com/2016/11/03/point-cloud-library-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts/ 
and it's predecessor article, about compiling from source. 
To install it, it's about as simple as installing the deb, but YOU MUST HAVE ALL DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED TO BUILD. 
For example, seeing his previous example and installing openni/kinect stuff, or libpcl-dev, and check vtk and qt are installed. Also libproj-dev. 
Also, in /usr/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfig.cmake, there's a line, ~746, which sets the PCL_ROOT to /usr/local, but when installed by .deb, it's in /usr. Correct that or cmake won't work. 
A few useful tools. I tried to make the pclSimpleCloudViewer, but error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so. Ran "stat /usr/.../libproj.so" and it said it couldn't be found. Installed "apt-file", ran "sudo apt-file update". Ran "apt-file search /usr/.../libproj.so" and it reported that it was found under the library "libproj-dev: /usr/.../libproj.so". Install libproj-dev. 
Cannot find -lvtk...: install libgl1-mesa-dev, libqt5-dev, libqt5opengl5-dev, libqt5opengl5-gles-dev libvtk6*
Did do a sudo apt-get update --fix missing and then a apt-get upgrade. 
Errors with libpcl_io undef ref to xn... has to do with bad openni install, see the blog above.
