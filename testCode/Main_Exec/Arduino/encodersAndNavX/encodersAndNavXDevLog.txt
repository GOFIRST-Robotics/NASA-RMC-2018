-Working on Arduino getting NavX to work with arduino, attempting to grab only the accels and yaw,roll,pitch isn't working perhaps an issue with what is being pulled by requestFrom()?
-Important Note: Baud 115200
-made a navXangles.ino in personal files because thats how arduino ide is setup, cleared out UART and SPI code from example and attempting to get the specific values now

Andrew:
-Continuing goal of getting data from NavX through Arduino
-Still can't get data from Accelerometer and Gyros at the same time
-Got byte info from gyro to print to the arduino serial console
-used navX built-in byte to float converter,
 however yaw claims to be rotation around x (inaccurate),
 roll and pitch print 0. Likely an issue with how I'm dealing with the input 
 arrays.
-changed beginTransmission input to be 50 (decimal of 0x32)

Andrew:
-Got Linear Accels and Gyro stuff to print to serial monitor at the same time, had to use different Wire.read() arrays for each sensor
-have formatter code setup to send to master and it compiles, but dont know how to test if it works right now

Andrew:
-Arduino code for angles and accelerations is setup, compiles, and runs, however there seems to be an issue with the way the data is added to the format as the value sent is a constant not based on any inputs.
