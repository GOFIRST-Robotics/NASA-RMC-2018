Andrew:
-Moved Molly's work into folders for reference/referal.
-Created wrapper class LIDAR over scanse's sweep class
-inorder to compile with this setup // g++ -std=c++11 [yourfile] -lsweep
-creates an a.out to be run as follows: ./a.out /dev/ttyUSB# [where # is the USB port in use (0,1 are common)]
-USB ports appear to be static in regards to physical ports matching virtual ones though I can't confirm this now
