(to use git hub:
git status
git add
git commit
git pull
git push

push - updates github with what you have
pull - updates what you have with what github has
commit - saves the changes you have made, but only locally
easy - build rig for lidar 

after building pointcloud, (assuming it's good) 

make a MATLAB pointcloud of ground, rocks, holes
make code to separate out the rocks and holes from the pointcloud
