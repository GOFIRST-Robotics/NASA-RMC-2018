Localization DevLog

Andrew:
The following is the rough goal of the localization class right now
-get serial data of the NavX and Grayhill Encoders from the arduino
-create an addData() method that parses the data from the NavX and Encoder
-updates the global state of the localization class -angles variables, -ticks variable
-do math to determine how from the robot is from the origin position
-for the encoder a constant for sandslip = 1, for wheel diameter = 9.5 * pi, gear ratio = 1 all of these go into an equation that says 256 ticks = 1 base rotation and turning that into a linear distance.
