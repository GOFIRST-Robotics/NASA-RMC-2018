2018 Feb 20: Jude: On communicating between computers, aka any and the pi, tested with python. 
the router, or computer, is the server, and the pi is the client
the pi sends UDP packets to the server
in python, server:
import socket
hostname = socket.getbyhostname( '0.0.0.0')
portNo = 5005
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind((hostname,portNo))
while True:
	data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024)
	print "recvfrom addr: ", addr
	print "data: ",  data

in python, client:
import socket
serverIP = important!
portNo = 5005
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
#sending:
sock.sendto("MESSAGE", (serverIP, portNo))

This is the basics of UDP communication. 
Current Goals: 
make a computer the "client", connect joystick, publish js values to server
-> pi is the server, do blinky led stuff & print off the published  messages
-> develop server & client code. 
-> see github that will exist
replace gofirst router with "Our" router, set that up
connect pi to stuff to run motors; 

For now, no ros. 
BTW: this is a dev file. If _YOU_, who is anyone being productive, learn or experiment with stuff & are confused & are doing stuff, dump your stream of thought on here. 
Just dump all your thinking & confusion & stuff in here. Make it a sewer of development. It's raw, filthy, disorganized, and invaluable. 

2018 Feb 21: Jude: 
Everyone, read Beej's guide to network programming. Can test with python udp communication.
Started to get router working. in webpage, access it by ip address, in a PRIVATE tab. Permanately added pi as 192.168.1.117
Can send msgs to pi, can't send yet to router/computer. Almost plugnplay?

2018 Feb 23 Molly:
Beej's send and receive files are in cpp_socket on desktop.
./send (ip to send to) "(message)"
./rec
Next Goals:

	Have server code on laptop,  pi connected to router,  laptop wired to router
	client code on pi

	Continuously send information

	Set up receive to be in a loop - Done, send "s" to quit
	Set up joystick to send from laptop
//PI receives, Computer sends, eventually put the sending and receiving into function
//script on pi to connect via serial to arduino, sending messages from pi to arduino
//script on arduino to connect to motor controllers write pin number
//alt tab to change windows

Current Goal:

Connect joystick to pi, send via usb to arduino instead of blinking LED
(y axis of left and right)

2018 Feb 28 Matt:
Pygame will give number of axes, buttons, etc. but won't recognize when the buttons are being pressed
Fixed by >>>pygame.display.init() #py at beginning and >>>pygame.event.pump()#py in the loop

Can't send data to the Arduino serial port because the resource is busy
Run >>>fuser /dev/ttyACM0 #bash to list processes using the file

2018 Mar 2:
Trying to send data over serial to Arduino but port is busy
>>>sudo adduser ubuntu dialout #bash and >>>such chomod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0 #bash to add premissions
>>>sudo udevadm trigger #bash to make it realize changes have been made
No difference, exact same error
>>>sudo apt-get purge modemmanager #bash to remove modemmanager, also no effect
>>>fuser /dev/ttyACM0 #bash gives 1426
>>>pkill 1426 #bash does nothing, fuser still returns 1426

Note: Use a small delay (like 10) so that it isn't too jerky
Python script must not be running when you upload over arduino.  Arduino serial monitor cannot be open or the python script 
will have an error.
Do not send spaces in the data being sent.
We were able to send data from the arduino to the python script, but even after using decode, the values were only 1 digit.
We send the data for the left and right joysticks in one line so that if data is lost it doesn't desyncronize the arduino knowing which
is left and which is right.
Next step is to have serial to arduino.py  to be in c++
removed GPIO from pyserial
installed library from https://github.com/wjwwood/serial
Jude thinks that the problem not being able to ping from the pi the laptop is a Windows problem, not a router problem

2018 Mar 9 Molly:
The passphrase for ssh is ubuntu
Here is how to compile an example script from the serial library:
g++ -o example1 serial_example.cc /home/ubuntu/Documents/Libraries/serial/build/devel/lib/libserial.so


2018 Mar 14 Jude:
Minyoung joined our group
People need to put more stuff on dev log
Minyoung is working on the collector bin thing. Goals: the robot can observe from it (target(s) and/or beacon(s)) the distance, and the angle from it; 
Jude is cleaning up docs & files, adding to github. Had finished communication prototype, testing. Need to integrate with serial/joystick code

2018 Mar 20 Molly
2 programs:
1) on laptop - reads joystick, sends thru telecom					= joystick_to_telecom.cpp		these are in Desktop - NASA - testCode - ArduinoSerial...
2) on pi - receives from telecom, sends via serial to arduino		= serial_to_arduino.cpp
3) (arduino code for testing - done but it's called like Mar21 or something undescriptive like that)

for telecom, put in send and receive is good enough
~/Documents/Libraries/serial/examples$ g++ -o example2 serial_example.cc -lserial

2018 Mar 21 Matt:
New program serial_to_arduino_print.cpp, compiled as serialtest 4
Should input a string from the user, send it to the Arduino via serial, get it back from the Arduino, and print the result
Current problem: result string from Arduino is always the empty string
Verfied the serial port is open, not the issue

Jude: I need to add a way to add arbitrary fd's to telecomm, make easy for joystick, write remote file for that. 

2018 Mar 23 Matt:
Changed joystick_to_telecom.cpp to print the joystick values to the Arduino via serial
Currently doesn't work: on the Arduino, Serial.available() always evaluates to 0
Molly:
Fixed math in joystick_to_telecom.cpp to values from -1 to 1

2018 Mar 28 Matt:
Normal serial port /dev/ttyACM0 was missing, other options didn't work
Fixed by swapping usb cord between the Pi and the Arduino and the one powering the Pi
New error, .../bin/avr-g++ file or directory missing, reinstalling Arduino

After reinstall and updating boards, programs can be uploaded again
Serial.available() is still evaluating to 0
We can manually enter two floats into the Arduino serial monitor to prove that the Arduino side works
The values must be getting lost/changed somehow between writing on the c++ side and receiving on the Arduino side

2018 April 3 Molly:
Added LIDAR to testCode.  In order to run the LIDAR data collection code, you will need to install the "libsweep" c++ library found here: 
https://github.com/scanse/sweep-sdk

Andrew:
-Updated navX library path on my pc
-Modified IMUProtocol.h, added the following, #include <cstdint>, this stopped errors regarding all variables of type "uint8_t" or "uint16_t" and possibly other "uintX_t" if in the file
-Note in /usr/local/include placing the library .h files in an "ahrs" folder did not solve the issue of chained .h files not being found, instead the chained .h files from the navX library have to be placed in the /usr/local/include directory specifically not in another folder
-A program for testing displacement functions is written but will not compile w/o error. written 29 Mar
-Will investigate another folder structure to test if compilation works then

2018 Apr 4 Matt:
Took calibration pictures for ArUco, using GOFIRST shop webcam
Trying to create calibration file for webcam, using meters as unit of measure (-size is 0.03614 meters)
Having trouble making the library work; can't get files to compile

Andrew:
-Changed DeadReckoning folder structure to remove src and include directories, all .h and .cpp files now reside in the same folder
-build commands to compile are mkdir build, cd build, cmake .., make
-however currently does not compile "error: no matching function for call to ‘AHRS::AHRS()’ NavX::NavX(std::string serial_port_id)"
-NavX.h updated with methods Close and the two constructors, as well as adding a private instance of AHRS ahrs
-NavX.cpp was created as the wrapper for AHRS's methods which we will be using

2018 Apr 6 Matt:
Library is installed properly and files are compiled by following instructions here:
http://miloq.blogspot.com/2012/12/install-aruco-ubuntu-linux.html
New error when trying to run aruco_calibration_fromimages:
error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_calib3d3.so.3.3: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument
Found post which said to install execstack and run >>>sudo execstack -c /usr/local/lib/libopencv_* #bash, no change

2018 Apr 7 Minyoung:
Added VisionBeacons folder in testCode. VisionBeacons is a class for getting localization data by measuring distance between two psmove beacons and possibly size of each beacons.
Need to find the tight range for HSV values so that only beacons can be tracked.

2018 April 8 Jude: 
Building a camera class for interfacing with the cameras. Building frameworks for this. 
Fixing codebase in deadreckoning, need to fix the cmake file to install into system, it's broken. 

2018 April 9 Molly:
Added LIDAR classes - The LIDARclass worked at one point but was not what was needed.  The LIDAR class is needed but does not work.  Will fix.

2018 April 10 Andrew:
installed Lidar Lite library to the raspi but its being finicky with the included test program, will investigate tomorrow, note to run the file "python3 test.py"

Minyoung: kept writing VisionBeacons class. Found the right range for psmove beacons. Will finish tomorrow. To do list: get distance between two beacons and horizontal angle.

2018 April 11 Andrew:
-we are not using python for lidar lite, ignore previous devlog post from me regarding python.
-lidar lite needs 500mA to initialize, achieved by routing through arduino hooked up to the 12v battery on the test rig.
-attempting to run the test program gives "write error 121-1" each time the lidar is pinged, narrowed error source down to functions in the i2cdev library possibilities: "dev_i2c_open", "dev_i2c_set_slave_addr", "dev_i2c_close"

2018 April Jude: 
I was using libconfig, after looking for a good config library online to store datatypes in, and started making a Config class. It's still there, and probably good (if completely raw and untested/compiled). I saw how Matt's webcam params config file however was in yaml, and it got me thinking. A bit too late, as most of the class is done, but I looked at opencv, and they have a great file io read/write parameters already sort of thing, good enough not to make a separate class for it. 
See: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/dd/d74/tutorial_file_input_output_with_xml_yml.html
I have almost finished camera. Matt wsa having quite a few problems. We found out ros, kinetic, ships with opencv 3.3.1 by default, which is also found by default for opencv. This fails however, when using libcalib3d. You need to force 3.4.1, and the way which worked for us is to say >>> 
include_directory(/usr/local/ /usr/local/lib/ /usr/local/include/)
in the cmake file, because it will then first search those directories, where the most recent version would be used. 
Other interesting errors occured with him. Doubting when will finish this. 

2018 April 11 Jude
Finished Camera. Wrote dummy class to use it. 
Minyoung: still working on VisionBeacons class. Working on how to use blob detection so that I can find two points from each beacon to measure distance between them.

2018 April 12 
Jude: compiling sample program with opencv. To see if we can find the library, or the right flags, do 
pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv # bash
This also tells you the paths, the -I/path/to/include/headers/ and -L/path/to/libs/, and you can put it in the g++ compile line itself: 
g++ -o tst.out test.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` # bash

2018 April 11-12 Matt:
get_pose.cpp: input image taken by webcam of calibration grid, outputs rotation and translation vectors for pose
I was never able to compile anything normally, so I put my new file get_pose.cpp under utils directory of aruco library
I added 
add_executable(get_pose get_pose.cpp)
target_link_libraries(get_pose aruco opencv_calib3d)
to the CMakeLists.txt and when I build it compiles correctly
Currently, it assumes that the yml file for camera calibration and the grid are one directory up from the compiled location

Minyoung: Worked on VisionBeacons class. Works fine when the beacons are close to camera. When it is faraway(roughly, when distance>2.5m), blobs are not detected. Also, the threshold range is white, there might be noise problems(depending on location).
The VisionBeacons class should work but still need to fix to be more robust.

2018 April 13 
Minyoung: Installed linuxbrew on RPi.
